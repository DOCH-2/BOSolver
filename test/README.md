Proper Installation Test
------------------------

To check whether the package is normally installed, run the following command. (this requires *pytest* Python package)

```bash
pytest proper_install_test.py
```

This should run without any errors. If it does not, please check the installation instructions again, or versions of libraries that are installed.

Performance Test
----------------

We prepared the bond perception performance comparison test among BOSolver, RDKit, and Openbabel.
