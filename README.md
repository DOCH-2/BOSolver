# BOSolver
Bond Order Solver utilizing linear integer programming

BOSolver calculates the CORRECT bond orders of bonds between atoms from XYZ file of molecule(s).
Lewis diagram drawing procedure is translated into Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and BOSolver solves the bond order assignment problem *EXACTLY* when elements of atoms, connectivity, and total charge is provided.
